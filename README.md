## Territory Tactician
The project is a territory management and strategy game where players choose to build and manage either a Kingdom or a Dynasty. Players are tasked with:

1. Assigning villagers (with various professions like Knights, Blacksmiths, Farmers, etc.) to different buildings (such as Homes, Forges, and Barracks).
2. Managing resources like food production and gold, ensuring the survival and growth of their territory.
3. Enhancing the territory by leveraging the unique benefits of each villager's profession (e.g., Knights increase defense, Farmers produce food, Blacksmiths enhance attack power).
4. Building structures within the territory and managing the capacity and profession distribution within those buildings.
5. Fighting enemy territories, using accumulated resources and defense strategies to attack and defend against other territories.
6. Players can also restart the game, wiping their progress and starting fresh by selecting a new Kingdom or Dynasty to manage.
